# odin-recipes

My first TOP assignment! In this project, I will create a simple website to practice the basic HTML skills I have learned so far.
The website will contain multiple pages containing food recipes with descriptions and pictures.

Update:
I have finished the project based on the instructions in the assignment.
My index page contained a header and 3 links to the recipes that I have selected. The links were nested in an unordered list structure so that they weren't in the same line.
The recipe pages contained the recipe's name, a picture of the finished food, and some unordered and ordered lists of the required ingredients and the steps to make the dish.

This project was really beneficial to me, as I had some success while building the site and practice not only the HTML elements, but also the Git commands.
